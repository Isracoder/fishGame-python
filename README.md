# A simple game that I developed using Pygame 💻

## The goal of the game 🏆🐟 : 
You will play as a fish aiming to clean up his environment and avoid predators 🐡 . Try to get the purple power up plant in order to avoid damage from predators and toxic waste 🥾🥤 . When powered up (noticable by a purple halo) you can eat the garbage , gain points , and the monster fish won't damage you.
Try to get enough points before time runs out and pay attention to your health !!

## Tech used : 
The game was developed using python, specifically pygame after my first year of uninversity. 👩‍💼   
All the pixel art in the game was drawn by me using piskel 🎨, and the sounds were downloaded from the internet.
